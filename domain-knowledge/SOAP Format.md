## Subjective
- S: Describe your impressions of the client in the subjective section. Include your impressions about the client’s/patient’s level of awareness, motivation, mood, willingness to participate. You may also list here anything the patient and/or family may say to you during a session.
For example: The client appeared very alert and cooperative. He stated, “I’m ready to work hard today.”

## Objective
- O: Write measurable information in the objective section. Your data goes here. Include any test scores, percentages for any goals/objectives worked on, and any quantitative information.
For instance: The client produced four syllable phrases with 80% accuracy in 40 out of 50 trials (40/50).

## Assessment
- A: Describe your analysis of the session in the assessment section. This is the interpretation section. Insurance companies like it when you compare the client’s performance across sessions.
For example: (a) Production of /r/ increased from 65% accuracy during the last session to 90% accuracy during today’s session. (b) Withdrawal of visual models resulted in a decrease in accurate production of single syllable words from 90% to 65%.

## Plan
- P: Outline the course of treatment in the plan section. Any changes to objectives, activities, reinforcement schedules should be included.
You might simply state: (a) Continue current treatment activities. (b) Continue training production of functional CVC words at the phrase level.
