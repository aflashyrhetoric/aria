## Recurring Criticisms
- Repetitive & boring activities
- Articulation words can be a little off (`lymph` for practicing `L` sounds)

## Missing from all:
- Data visualizations of progress
- Hyper-simple parent portal
  - Automatically-generated templated **progress** reports for parents
  - Easily manipulatible wordsets
